What’s new in the world of Forgotten Runes? What have Elf and Dotta been up to? Besides our weekly Wizard Wednesdays, check back here regularly to find out the latest FRWC news!

So, what’s brewing behind the scenes?

## Sprite Sheets

Currently, our Wizards exist as beautiful static images minted as NFTs. But FR Wizards are meant for so much more...

Elf is currently undertaking the arduous task of drawing the front, sides, and back views of every single head, body, and familiar in the collection. This equates to roughly 240 pieces of art being tripled, for a total of 720 new sprites!

Then we will take these parts and assemble them in the exact combinations of our 10k collection.

**Every Wizard holder will get their Wizard drawn in 360 degrees.**

It’s a lot to take on, but Elf is roughly half way through. So why are we doing this?

## Games and Metaverses

If you want your Wizard to walk around in a metaverse, they will need to walk in all directions!

We will use these turnarounds to extract walk cycles, emotes, battle stances, and other poses required for full interaction in the metaverse.

We are talking to many partners about allowing Wizards to walk freely in other metas. Additionally, we are making moves to create our own meta based on the current map of the Forgotten Runes world.

This meta will be a place for Wizards to socialize, adventure, and battle monsters. There is so much to say about this meta, but more details will need to wait for a future blog post.

Another interesting use for these turnarounds will leverage the creativity of our community. Currently you can [download your Wizard in easily editable parts.](/posts/how-to-use-aseprite-for-wizards)

Our Cult members have been making AMAZING art and animations with their Wizards and sharing them on social media. With these new sprites, our holders will be able to expand their artistic expressions and show Wizards doing things from any angle!

## The Forgotten Runes Book of Lore

In addition to sprites, probably the most exciting development is the Book of Lore. This device will be a groundbreaking feature unique to Forgotten Runes, something no other NFT project has.

Since launch, our holders have been creating a staggering amount of artwork, animation, stories, poems, and other media expressions to supplement their Wizards. They have been building out their characters, bringing life to them. We knew this lore development needed to be saved on the blockchain, so that it could be preserved forever along with the Wizards themselves. Hence, the Forgotten Runes Book of Lore.

This Book will be an online compendium where any Wizard holder can attach art, stories, poems, or any NFT artifact to Wizards they own. Over time, we imagine this tome will become a massive wealth of information detailing the biographical history of each Wizard. We believe that a Wizard with well developed lore can become a legendary NFT.

## The Great Burning

In the near future, The Secret Tower on our website will undergo a subtle transformation. Wizard holders will have the opportunity to commit the unspeakable act of burning their Wizard!!! This act, while incredibly risky, will destroy the Wizard but may potentially return a mysterious Ghost Wizard. The exact details of the Great Burning have yet to be revealed, but for those who choose to take part in this even, be warned:

## Other Media Expressions

There will be more news in the coming months regarding other operations such as a Forgotten Runes comic book, animated shorts, and gallery shows. Dotta and Elf are taking meetings every single day to make these things a reality, and honestly we’ve made great progress. We consistently receive genuine interest from these third parties in the entertainment industry, and cannot wait to share more details!
